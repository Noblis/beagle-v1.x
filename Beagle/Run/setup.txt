Must install driver from https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx
To use LibDevice must install CUDA Toolkit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads and

make sure CUDA_PATH and CUDA_HOME environmental variable exists and points to
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.2 (change version)

Troubleshooting: After context is created, verify that context properties LibDevicePath and LibNvvmPath
are resolved correctly and are pointing to actual files

- Execute Run project in Release mode
- Sit back, relax and watch Beagle do its thing... :)
